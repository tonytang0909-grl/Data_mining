# Data Mining notes

### Data Visualization 

#### 4-v of current data

Volume, Velocity, Veracity, Variety

Volume: Current data offen come in gigantic volume, hence why called mining in the first place

Velocity: The speed that current data cummulate are astonishing fast

Veracity: Noise offen contains in current data sample

Variety: All kinds of data, txt, video, sound, ... exist

- What is the relationship and difference between Volume and Velocity? 

  The relationship of Volume and Velocity is that Velocity determines the accumulation speed of the data, hence the change rate of the volume.

  The difference is that we have to use different algorithms to tackle the two perspectives of the Sample Set. 

- Explain with examples what Veracity refers to. How might Veracity affect Data Mining? 

  Simply means noice which is irrelevant data in the data sample. 

#### Data visulization 

 **t-SNE visualisation**

 t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE)

**Parallel chart and its extension, deviation chart**

**Heatmaps**
